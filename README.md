A Facial Recognition system

# Overview
An attempt to make facial recognition technology into a web service that can authenticate people over the web.

# Progress so far
- The model
  The model was constructed with the python module known as *keras*

- The endpoint
  The endpoint for the api was setup using flask then recreated using django framework
  
- The Frontend (Test)
  The front end designed to test the system was built in HTML, CSS and javascript (vanilla). The frontend communicated with the backend via AJAX and the fetch API
  
# RoadBlock
  - The camera API (from the navigator.getUsermedia) seems to ready or I am unable to work with it well. I will appreciate any help with it, contact me if you can help

This was a side project I did between other things so I may not have devoted enough time and attention to it (and that maybe why i have not really looked into the roadblock extensively).

# Credits
shoutout to @blackgeeknerd(https://github.com/blackgeeknerd) and an anonymous COnsonance member who helped me out with the fetching of the image from the front end, and of course Google and Stackoverflow :-)
